        <h1>Tiramisu Recipe</h1>
        <p>
            <ol>    
                <li>Gather the following ingredients:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ladyfingers</li>
                    <li>Mascarpone: it wouldnâ€™t be true tiramisu without mascarpone, but if you absolutely must, you could substitute cream cheese.</li>
                    <li>Coffee: I use espresso, but dark roast works fine</li>
                    <li>Coffee liqueur like Kahlua</li>
                    <li>Heavy Whipped cream</li>
                    <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
                    <li>Vanilla extract: or substitute imitation vanilla</li>
                    <li>Cocoa powder: for dusting on top</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). </li>
                <li>Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks.</li>
                <li>Add mascarpone cheese and fold in until combined. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl.</li> 
                <li>Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar size pan.</li> 
                <li>Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top.</li>
                <li>Add another layer of dipped lady fingers.</li>
                <li> remaining mascarpone cream over the top.</li>
                <li>Dust cocoa powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh strainer to do this).</li> 
                <li>Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.</li>
            </ol>
